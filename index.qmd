## Introduction

The literature assessment on its usage in sports science in rugby, basketball, and soccer, the review highlighted the most important elements for designing training programs, analyzing performance, and identifying talent.
The social effects of intelligent sports systems were the subject of another research assessment. The study employed PCA and fuzzy control technologies as analytical techniques to pinpoint the main causes of these systems' social consequences. PCA was used to evaluate the survey data that the authors collected through a user survey of intelligent sports systems. Their research showed that perceptions of these social consequences are the most important contributing elements.

The use of PCA was recommended in a literature study on tracking athlete performance in team sports, with an emphasis on NCAA Division-I Men's Basketball contests, in order to simplify large datasets and produce insightful results. The evaluation emphasized the need of producing daily reports on individual player readiness and distributing them to the coaching staff via the performance and sports medical staff.

Summary: 
The paper proposes a new method for dimensionality reduction for neural network-based PCA.
The proposed method is called adaptive dimensionality reduction (ADR).
ADR is a two-step process. In the first step, ADR uses a neural network to learn the principal components of the data. In the second step, ADR uses a stopping rule to determine the number of principal components to keep.
The stopping rule in ADR is based on the idea that if the principal components are not changing significantly, then ADR stops learning new principal components.
The authors evaluated ADR on a variety of data sets and found that it was able to achieve better performance than traditional PCA methods.

Summary:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method employed to reduce the complexity of data while retaining critical information. The core concept behind PCA is to identify linear combinations of the original variables that capture as much of the data's variability as possible.
These combinations, known as principal components, are arranged in such a way that the first one explains the highest variance within the data. Subsequent components are ordered to maximize variance while remaining orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the preceding ones.
PCA has found wide-ranging applications, including data visualization, clustering, and classification. Recent advancements in PCA encompass its application to large-scale datasets (big data), integration with other machine learning techniques, and the development of more robust PCA approaches capable of handling outliers with greater resilience.
