Dietary habits of Polish esports players were analyzed using principle component analysis. It is known that nutrition can affect performance, so the researchers wanted to find common dietary trends. It was found that gaming over time is correlated with poor dietary habits.

In a study of the causes of climate change in Bangladesh, principle component analysis was used to reduce a list of 31 indicators to 7, which were Demographic Vulnerability, Economic Vulnerability, Agricultural Vulnerability, Water Vulnerability, Health Vulnerability, Climate Vulnerability, and Infrastructural Vulnerability.

Researchers believe that the Covid-19 pandemic may influence investors' decisions to invest more or less money in the stock market. This could give insight into how public health concerns may be able to predict future behavior in the stock market. Analysis showed that investors invested less money when concerned about Covid-19.

Researchers explain principal component analysis in detail and use examples to explain it. When performing principal component analysis, principal component analysis creates linear combinations of variables. The number of principal components can be less than or equal to the original number of variables. The number of principal components can be increased or decreased based on the accuracy of the model.

Principal component analysis is explained using an example of food choices in different countries. The data set used has 17 dimensions, but these dimensions are reduced to 2 principal components that account for 97% of the variation. This article shows an effective use of principal component analysis, by obtaining an accurate model that is much simpler than the original data set.

Researchers applies principal component analysis and linear regression was applied to study quality of drinking water to find pollution sources. Five principal components were used, and 83.1% of the variance is explained by these five components. It was found that the primary forms of pollution was waste from cities.
