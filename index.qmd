## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that can be used to reduce the dimensionality of complex data sets and highlight key variables. PCA was used for analysis of player techniques in different sports, such as football, basketball, rugby, dance, diving, gymnastics, skiing and more to figure out what those variables are that could have an important influence on the development of training programs, performance analysis or identification of talents within these sports [@bro].

PCA was used for robust data analysis to identify the most relevant variables [@pino] through PCA in soccer, basketball, and rugby. The systematic review encompassed 34 studies and employed PCA for robust data analysis. In the realm of sports science, this has profound implications: Performance Enhancement, Tailored Training Programs, Performance Analysis, and Talent Identification.

PCA can assist in pinpointing the pivotal factors contributing to athletes' performance, design personalized training regimes, cater to individual athletes' strengths and weaknesses, facilitate in-depth analysis of performance data, offer insights into areas for improvement, and help in identifying and nurturing talented athletes, crucial for sports development.

A combination approach involving PCA, Random Forest and Genetic Algorithm to classify sport actions based on 3D motion data [@weiwei]. PCA has been used in order to reduce dimensionality of the data, a hybrid classification scheme combining PCA and RF is proposed. The report presents an innovative approach to the classification of sporting actions which relies on 3D motion data derived from advanced techniques, such as PCA, RF and GA, with a view to achieving superior accuracy.

Finally, PCA is a key Statistical Method for Sports Science which may contribute to reducing the dimensionality of complex data sets and highlighting critical variables. It will have a profound impact on the enhancement of performance, tailored training programs, analysis of individual performances and identification of talent. Innovation approaches to the use of PCAs in sports science were demonstrated by [@pino] and [@weiwei].

### Literature Review



[1] Researchers explain principal component analysis in detail and use examples to explain it. When performing principal component analysis, it creates linear combinations of variables. The number of principal components can be less than or equal to the original number of variables. The number of principal components can be increased or decreased based on the accuracy of the model.
In this article we see that 44 red wine samples were collected all originating from the same grape variety, Cabernet Sauvignon. These samples are collected from various regions.
This study uses Foss Wine scan instrument to conduct measurements on 14 characteristics parameters of these wines like ethanol content, pH content etc. This showcases how Principal Component Analysis can be an important tool for extracting meaningful patterns with insights [@bro].



[2] Researchers applies principal component analysis and linear regression to study quality of drinking water to find pollution sources. Five principal components were used, and 83.1% of the variance is explained by these five components. It was found that the primary forms of pollution was waste from cities [@mustapha].


[3] Researchers believe that the Covid-19 pandemic may influence investors' decisions to invest more or less money in the stock market. In this study, stock market data was analyzed along with the psychology of the investors. The negative emotions experienced by investors made them more likely to avoid investing in the stock market. Investors cared more about their health and well-being than their wealth [@naseem].


[4] Principal component analysis is explained using an example of food choices in different countries. The data set used has 17 dimensions, but these dimensions are reduced to 2 principal components that account for 97% of the variation. This article shows an effective use of principal component analysis, by obtaining an accurate model that is much simpler than the original data set [@richardson].


[5] Principal component analysis was used to analyze dietary habits of Polish esports players. Subjects were given a questionnaire about their dietary habits. The questionnaire consisted of 145 different food items, that were reduced to 37 groups of food. The subjects were also asked about the frequency at which they consume these food items. Other dietary habits were analyzed, such as meal frequency and hydration [@szot].


[6] Researchers have identified Bangladesh as an area that will be significantly vulnerable to climate change. This study was done to reduce the identified vulnerabilities into categories of vulnerability.

[8] PCA  has been used in various sports, including dance, diving, gymanastics, skiing, and etc to analyze the technique of a player. In sports technique is often a critical factor for success and a defining characteristic of top athletes. It refers to specific coordinated patterns that athletes develop through practice.
PCA is an important factor in sports because it is essential to know the moments, strengths and weaknesses of our own performance to improve in future. Identifying potential beneficial changes in an athlete’s technique is a major challenge [@gloersen].

In this study Six elite cross-country skiers we involved, all of them were male. Among six skiers, three were members of Norwegian National Team and had achieved podium finishes in world cup. The other three skiers were also high-level athletes.
The study utilized a performance measure known as “FIS Points”, which stands for Federation International Ski points. FIS are calculated by players time difference from winner’s finishing time. Lower FIS points indicate better performance.
Limitation: - Must do individual analysis on each player. Even if we do a analysis on a whole team, it would only be most effective if we do a individual analysis and combine it together.

[9] In this article we see the importance of assessing performance using notational analysis to identify critical patterns and events that can impact the outcomes of a team.

Notational analysis in sports has become a critical tool for identifying key patterns and events that can lead to a successful outcome. Various statistical techniques are used to analyze the data and PCA is one of the most important technique to visualize tactical and technical responses.
PCA is valuable for objectively selecting critical variables, especially when variablesare chosen based on professional experience or evidence-based information [@rojas].

[15] The paper proposes a new method for dimensionality reduction for neural network-based PCA.
The proposed method is called adaptive dimensionality reduction (ADR).
ADR is a two-step process. In the first step, ADR uses a neural network to learn the principal components of the data. In the second step, ADR uses a stopping rule to determine the number of principal components to keep.
The stopping rule in ADR is based on the idea that if the principal components are not changing significantly, then ADR stops learning new principal components.
The authors evaluated ADR on a variety of data sets and found that it was able to achieve better performance than traditional PCA methods [@migenda].


[16] Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method employed to reduce the complexity of data while retaining critical information. The core concept behind PCA is to identify linear combinations of the original variables that capture as much of the data's variability as possible.
These combinations, known as principal components, are arranged in such a way that the first one explains the highest variance within the data. Subsequent components are ordered to maximize variance while remaining orthogonal (uncorrelated) to the preceding ones.
PCA has found wide-ranging applications, including data visualization, clustering, and classification. Recent advancements in PCA encompass its application to large-scale datasets (big data), integration with other machine learning techniques, and the development of more robust PCA approaches capable of handling outliers with greater resilience [@jolliffe].


[17] This method hinges on the concept of segregating the illumination and reflection components within the image, effectively addressing the challenges posed by low-light conditions.
